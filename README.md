# SignsInTheSky
This project was originally created for the fourth Extra Credits Game Jam on Itch.io.  the theme was "Connections", so this is a connect the dot puzzle game with a motif of constellations.

TODO:
1) Redo Nodes
	a) Create Line Renderer between any two nodes
	b) Right click on line to remove connection

2) Constellation - Change clear condition to reflect new nodes

Cool idea, but there are a few issues in execution. The fact that you can only form one connection from each star is not very intuitive. This also led to an issue where the constellation doesn't register as solved when two lines overlap. But if you sort out those issues and implement the other constellations this could be a nice little puzzle game, so great job overall!

The idea of connecting stars to form constellations is a great one. I can imagine a very zen game where you create your own out of a full skyscape. Very solid mechanic!
